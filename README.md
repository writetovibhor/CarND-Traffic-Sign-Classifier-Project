## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set and identify where in your code the summary was done. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

The code for this step is contained in the second code cell of the IPython notebook.  

I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset and identify where the code is in your code file.

The code for this step is contained in the fourth code cell of the IPython notebook.  

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It shows one of the input training images and further augmentation done to increase the training data. This visualization can be generated by setting `DO_TRAIN` and `DO_PLOT` to `True` in fourth code cell.

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. Describe how, and identify where in your code, you preprocessed the image data. What tecniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc.

The code for this step is contained in the fourth code cell of the IPython notebook.

As a first step, I decided to include histogram equalized versions of the images so that signs which are very dark are also trained properly. Then I included grayscale versions of the images so as to further enhance the training and compensate for changes in colors that might occur in test images. I then decided to include perspective shifted versions of the images so as to take care of camera looking at the traffic signs from various angles. I am performing each of these operations on the result of previous operation so that I can generate training data for various combinations such as hystogram-equalized-grayscale-perspective-left image etc.

Above image shows all the combinations for one of the training image. Now my training data increased from 34799 to 417588.

As a last step, I normalized the image data so that mean value of pixel data is zero and network does not overshoot and does not generate arbitrarily large numbers while performing multiplications.

####2. Describe how, and identify where in your code, you set up training, validation and testing data. How much data was in each set? Explain what techniques were used to split the data into these sets. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, identify where in your code, and provide example images of the additional data)

I used the pre-defined validation and test set. Code for initilizing this is in first code cell and I normalize the data in fourth code cell. My validation set had 4410 images and test set had 12630 images.

####3. Describe, and identify where in your code, what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

The code for my final model is located in the sixth cell of the ipython notebook. 

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x18 	|
| L2 norm               |                                               |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x18 				|
| Convolution 5x5	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x48   |
| L2 norm               |                                               |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x48   				|
| Flatten               | Outputs 1200                                  |
| Dense                 | Outputs 360                                   |
| RELU                  |                                               |
| Dropout               | keep_prob=0.7                                 |
| Dense                 | Outputs 252                                   |
| RELU                  |                                               |
| Dense                 | Outputs 43                                    |
| Softmax				|           									|

####4. Describe how, and identify where in your code, you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

The code for training the model is located in the tenth cell of the ipython notebook. 

To train the model, I used batch size of 256 with 25 epochs. I'm using AdamOptimizer with learning rate of 1e-4. 

####5. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

The code for calculating the accuracy of the model is located in the tenth cell of the Ipython notebook.

My final model results were:
* validation set accuracy of 95.9%
* test set accuracy of 93.8%

I started with standard Lenet architecture and improved my results with following changes.
* Switched from `truncated_normal` to `xavier_initializer` for initializing weights of convolutional layers.
* Added L2 normalization after each convolutional layer.
* Added dropout with `keep_prob = 0.7` before last two fully connected layers.
* I also played around with batch size, learning rate and epochs to find out most optimum combination.

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![German 1][image2]
![German 11][image3]
![German 22][image4]
![German 25][image5]
![German 34][image6]
![German 36][image7]

The first image might be difficult to classify because of shift in perspective, also the fourth image might be difficult to classify because of small details.

####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. Identify where in your code predictions were made. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the twelfth cell of the Ipython notebook.

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			                        |     Prediction	        			| 
|:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:| 
| Speed limit (30km/h)                  | Roundabout mandatory   				| 
| Right-of-way at the next intersection | Right-of-way at the next intersection |
| Bumpy road				        	| Bumpy road							|
| Road work	      		                | Road work					 			|
| Turn left ahead			            | Turn left ahead      					|
| Go straight or right                  | Go straight or right                  |


The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83.33%. If I use more images then the accuracy should go up to at least 93% which is what I got with test set.

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction and identify where in your code softmax probabilities were outputted. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

Here is the plot of top five softmax probabilities for the preditions of above images. For the first image, the model predicted with the probability of 88.96% that the image is a Roundabout mandatory and predicted with the probability of 11% that the image is a Speed limit (50km/h). The top five softmax probabilities for this image were.
For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign.
